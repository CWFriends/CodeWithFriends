#### What are Check-In Groups?

We'll create groups of 5 people who'll check in with each other on project progress. The goal is create a chance for people to create connections through the event, support each other, and hold each other accountable in a smaller group setting. You're welcome to create a group with people you know through the signup form, or have us choose randomly based on your timezone. You'll check in with each other every week on your project progress.
