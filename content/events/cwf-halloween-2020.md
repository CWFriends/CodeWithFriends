CWF 1.0 in May of 2020 was the first of its kind. It was a smaller scale event, that established the foundation of a chill, non-competitive a coding event. The premise of the event was to create a month-long coding event where folks could support each other in working on their personal projects.

The theme was quarantine, however anyone could work on anything, using anything they’d like. The projects didn’t need to be finished because the spirit of the event was to learn new things rather than create a polished and finished product.

In CWF 2.0, we want to build upon this foundation. While providing a non-competitive, supportive, and chilled environment for people to work on their projects, we want to provide some additional support around working on personal projects.

Namely, we’ll be adding a few enhancements:

* Idea Kits
* Check-in Groups
* Office Hours

#### Idea Kits

While participants can still work on whatever they’d like to, this time we’ll provide 10 kits: ready-made project ideas and technologies that people can choose to work on if they don’t already have an idea of their own.

#### Check-In Groups

Instead of having one giant Discord channel for check-ins where status updates get lost and things get noisy, we’ll create groups of 4-6 people. The goal is to allow folks to create connections through the event, support each other, and hold each other accountable in a smaller group setting. We’ll try to group these folks based on their project, technology, and/or their locale. They’ll check in with each other every week on their project progress.

#### Office Hours

Last time, we again had one giant Discord channel for technical help. Because of the diversity in technologies and projects, we think it’ll be more valuable for folks to have separate channels to go to ask specific technical questions. We’ll have mentors in each channel who’ll be differentiated (maybe through a role) who can answer questions asynchronously as questions come in to the chat.
