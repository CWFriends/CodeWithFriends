We're back in October for Code With Friends, which'll start on Thursday, October 1st to Saturday, October 31st.

Similar to the first CWF, this one is also whatever you want it to be. The event is a great way to start a brand new project or make meaningful progress on an existing one. While providing a non-competitive, supportive, and chilled environment for people to work on their projects, we want to provide some additional support around working on personal projects.

We'll have a few things in place to help you work on your project:

### Discord

Discord will be where our CWF community lives. All participants are encouraged to join our server as this is where live announcements, check-ins, and office hours will happen. Drop a line in #general-chat and say hello!

### Twitch Streams

Similar to the first CWF, Mayuko will be hosting co-working streams twice a week on Twitch (see schedule below). Think of this as going to a library or study hall with your friends - we'll all be working on our own personal projects. There'll be lo-fi chillhop background music along with a pomodoro timer to help us focus.

### Idea Kits

You can work on whatever project you'd like to. But in case you're looking for a project idea, we have a list of project ideas you can choose from to spur some inspiration.

### Check-In Groups

Last time we had one giant Discord channel for project status check-ins. This time, you can opt into a check-in group: a small group of 4-5 people who'll check in with each other on project progress . The goal is create a chance for people to create connections through the event, support each other, and hold each other accountable in a smaller group setting. You're welcome to create a group with people you know through the signup form, or have us choose randomly based on your timezone. You'll check in with each other every week on your project progress.

**Note: Sign up by September 29th to be assigned to a check-in group!**

### Labs

Last time, we had one giant Discord channel for technical help. Because of the diversity in technologies and projects, we'll have separate technology-specific channels on Discord to ask specific technical questions. Weâ€™ll have guides in each channel who can any questions you may have. Some guides will also have open Office Hours where they'll be online for 1-2 hours/week to answer any questions live.
