Code With Friends is a month-long coding event where folks from all over the world work on their personal coding projects together. It's neither a competition, nor a hackathon -- it's a place where anyone with any level of coding experience can come to learn new things, have fun building something, and be proud of the work they've accomplished. Brought to you by [Mayuko Inoue](hellomayuko.com), [Scott Kwang](https://www.twitch.tv/squatkong), and a team of incredible staff.
